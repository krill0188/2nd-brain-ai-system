# Wiki Schema

## Repository orientation

This repository root is the wiki root. Every wiki operation resolves paths from the
current project root; no database, hosted service, or separate vault is required.
Before curating, read this file, `index.md`, and the most recent entries in `log.md`.

## Three layers

1. **Layer 1 — raw immutable source evidence:** Markdown source records live under
   `raw/`. Their captured body is immutable except for the two narrow metadata
   operations defined below.
2. **Layer 2 — canonical pages:** Curated pages live only in `entities/`,
   `concepts/`, `comparisons/`, and `queries/`. These pages synthesize and connect
   raw evidence; they never replace it.
3. **Layer 3 — schema, navigation, and log metadata:** `SCHEMA.md` defines the
   contract, `index.md` is the complete canonical catalog, and `log.md` is the
   append-only action history.

Zero canonical pages is a valid wiki state. The initial repository deliberately
contains no raw source record and no canonical page.

## Directory roles

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `inbox/` | Temporary intake awaiting classification and capture; not canonical evidence. |
| `raw/articles/` | Immutable captured article or clipping Markdown. |
| `raw/notebooklm/` | Immutable importer-preserved NotebookLM source records and source identifiers. |
| `raw/papers/<topic>/` | Zotero 인제스트 Markdown 레코드. `<topic>`은 SCHEMA.md 등록 태그(drone-sw/drone-ai/datalink/swarm/drone-hw/voice-control/ai-agent) 또는 `_unclassified`. `scripts/zotero-ingest.py`가 자동 생성. |
| `raw/papers/files/` | Optional copied paper attachments; initially only the empty `.gitkeep` placeholder is allowed. |
| `raw/transcripts/` | Immutable captured transcript Markdown. |
| `raw/web/` | Immutable importer-preserved web captures whose existing provenance paths must remain stable. |
| `raw/youtube/` | Immutable importer-preserved video metadata and transcript captures. |
| `entities/` | Canonical pages whose exact `type` is `entity`. |
| `concepts/` | Canonical pages whose exact `type` is `concept`. |
| `comparisons/` | Canonical pages whose exact `type` is `comparison`. |
| `queries/` | Canonical filed syntheses whose exact `type` is `query`. |
| `_archive/` | Fully superseded canonical pages removed from active navigation. |

## File and frontmatter rules

- Markdown is UTF-8, uses LF line endings, and has no byte-order mark.
- Canonical file names use lowercase words separated by hyphens and end in `.md`;
  imported raw file names and relative paths are preserved exactly.
- Frontmatter, when required, starts at byte zero with `---` followed by LF.
- Every canonical page has these fields: `title`, `created`, `updated`, `type`,
  `tags`, `sources`, `confidence`, `contested`, and `contradictions`.
- Canonical `type` is exactly one of `entity`, `concept`, `comparison`, or `query`,
  and it must match the containing directory.
- `created` and `updated` are calendar dates. Preserve `created`; change `updated`
  whenever the page content or metadata changes.
- `confidence` is exactly `high`, `medium`, or `low`. Use `high` only for evidence
  supported across multiple sources.
- `contested` is a YAML boolean. When it is `true`, describe unresolved positions
  with dates and provenance in the body. `contradictions` is a list of canonical
  page slugs whose claims conflict; use an empty list when there is no conflict.

Templates live outside canonical directories and are not pages. All angle-bracket
tokens in a copied template must be replaced or removed before the copy can become
a valid source record or canonical page.

## Tag taxonomy

- Every tag used by a canonical page must first be registered in this section.
- Register a tag before using it, and keep its spelling stable.
- Add only tags that fit the chosen wiki domain; do not seed domain tags here.

### Registered tags

- `automation`: deterministic or agent-driven workflow automation.
- `comparison`: explicit side-by-side analysis of tools or methods.
- `knowledge-base`: durable, structured knowledge systems.
- `knowledge-graph`: graph-derived relationship analysis.
- `notebooklm`: source-scoped NotebookLM workflows.
- `pkm`: personal knowledge management.
- `provenance`: source traceability and claim lineage.
- `research`: research collection, synthesis, and verification.
- `workflow`: ordered operational processes and feedback loops.

#### Drone domain tags

- `drone`: general drone systems — airframes, flight mechanics, regulations, mission planning.
- `datalink`: drone data link and wireless communication — RF, LTE, MAVLink telemetry, C2 link.
- `swarm`: multi-drone coordination and swarm algorithms — formation, task allocation, consensus.
- `voice-control`: natural language and voice command interfaces for drone operation.
- `drone-hw`: drone hardware components — flight controllers, ESC, motors, batteries, sensors, cameras.
- `drone-sw`: drone software stack — firmware (PX4, ArduPilot), GCS, middleware, SDK, ROS/ROS2, MAVROS/MAVROS2.
- `drone-ai`: AI and ML integration with drones — computer vision, autonomous flight, detection, SLAM.
- `ai-agent`: AI agent architectures for autonomous drone decision-making and multi-agent systems.

## Raw source integrity

Initial capture establishes an immutable raw record. The `sha256` field is the
SHA-256 digest of the exact post-frontmatter body bytes: every byte after the LF
that terminates the closing `---` delimiter through end of file. For a Zotero
record this includes the readable Zotero metadata block, extracted-text suffix,
and the normalized final LF.

Byte-identical records copied from a trusted legacy vault may lack a recorded
`sha256`. Preserve those files exactly, record the whole-file source/target hash
comparison in `log.md`, and report the missing field as a hash-coverage gap rather
than source drift. Do not add frontmatter merely to normalize a legacy capture.
A trusted legacy copy may also retain its original missing final LF. Treat that as
a documented format gap, not permission to alter the immutable raw bytes.

Only these raw-record mutations are allowed:

1. **Zotero metadata repair:** replace raw frontmatter and the readable Zotero
   metadata block only, prove the extracted-text suffix remains byte-exact, and
   recompute `sha256` over the resulting complete post-frontmatter body.
2. **NotebookLM mapping:** change only byte-zero leading frontmatter, preserve
   every body byte, and preserve the existing `sha256` scalar byte-for-byte.

No other edit to a captured raw body is allowed. Corrections and interpretations
belong in canonical pages. A copied attachment does not substitute for its raw
Markdown record or for Zotero parent metadata.

## Provenance

- Every canonical `sources` item is an exact repository-relative path to an
  existing raw Markdown record under a source directory registered in the table
  above, including importer-preserved `raw/notebooklm/`, `raw/web/`, and
  `raw/youtube/` paths.
- Assets and attachments may support a raw record but are not canonical `sources`
  entries by themselves.
- Never invent, approximate, or retain a source path that does not resolve.
- Where a synthesized paragraph needs claim-level attribution, append a marker of
  the form `^[raw/<source-kind>/<source-file>.md]`. Use markers for multi-source
  synthesis, contested claims, or wherever the frontmatter list alone is
  ambiguous. Each marker must resolve to a path already listed in `sources`.

## Canonical link validity

Explicit Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` connect canonical pages. When the canonical set
is nonempty, every canonical page must contain at least two distinct, resolvable,
non-self links to other canonical pages. Targets must resolve to active Markdown
pages in one of the four canonical directories.

Therefore a one-page or two-page canonical set is invalid. A three-page set can be
valid only when every page satisfies the same two-target rule. Links to templates,
raw records, archived pages, headings in the same page, or missing targets do not
count toward the minimum.

## Page thresholds and maintenance

- Create a canonical page when its subject appears in at least two raw sources or
  is central to one source.
- Add evidence to an existing page when the subject is already covered.
- Do not create pages for passing mentions, minor details, or out-of-domain items.
- Split a canonical page when it grows beyond roughly 200 lines, preserving links
  and provenance in both resulting pages.
- Archive a page only when it is fully superseded. Move it under `_archive/`,
  remove it from `index.md`, update active links, and append the archive to
  `log.md`.

## Index and log synchronization

For every canonical create, update, filed query, archive, or delete operation:

1. Update `index.md` in the same operation. List every active canonical page once
   under its matching type, sort entries alphabetically, keep a one-line summary,
   and make the total equal the filesystem canonical-page count.
2. Append one entry to `log.md` in the defined heading format. Record the action,
   subject, and every repository-relative file created, updated, archived, or
   deleted.
3. Never list raw records, templates, or archived pages as active canonical index
   entries. Never rewrite or remove prior log entries.

When an index section exceeds 50 entries, divide it into stable subsections. When
the full index exceeds 200 entries, add a thematic navigation map without changing
the canonical count. Rotate the log only under its policy in `log.md`.
