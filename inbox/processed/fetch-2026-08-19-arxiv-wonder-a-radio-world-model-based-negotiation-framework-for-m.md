## Abstract

Post-disaster damage to terrestrial infrastructure can disrupt wireless coverage,while Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms provide a promising solution for rapid restoration.However, due to the limitations in local geometry observations hidden radio impact,and inter-UAV communication,there exists a significant gap between locally visible movement choices and swarm-level coverage outcomes.To combat this gap,we propose a raido World-model-based Optimized Negotiation framework for Distributed UAV covERage (WONDER).Particularly, to tackle the unavailability of the future radio field from onboard observations, WONDER uses a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)-based radio world model to learn and predict the incremental radio effect of each candidate trajectory from deployment-available information.Multi-round negotiation in WONDER then coordinates ranked proposals by committing one trajectory at a time and re-evaluating the remaining proposals under the updated context. Our theoretical analyses further validate the effectiveness of such a world model-based framework. WONDER also adopts a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-style Actor and alternates between updating the world model and the actor. Furthermore,we build RadioDynamics,a comprehensive simulation environment that integrates UAV mobility,radio propagation, inter-UAV communication modeling,and digital-twin geometry with ray-traced fields in $62$ metropolitan scenes.Experiments on $11$ testing scenes in RadioDynamics show that WONDER achieves the highest balanced score among seven evaluated methods,reaching $0.870$ with a $0.162$ coverage advantage over STACCA, while maintaining $100\%$ connectivity between UAVs.
